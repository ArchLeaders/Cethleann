Soft Engine data exploration and research, specifically centered around FE: Three Houses

**THIS LIBRARY DOES NOT SUPPORT SAVING OR COMPRESSING FILES.**

If you want to mod FETH please refer to https://github.com/three-houses-research-team

Maybe one day I will implement file repackaging, but right now it is not a priority.
KT's engine is enough of a nightmare trying to figure out which indices decode to what.
